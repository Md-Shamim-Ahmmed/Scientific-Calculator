# Scientific-Calculator
<p>
This is pretty Scientific-Calculator. It is my first web project. I actually create this project for my academic project purpose.
Using this calculator you can calculate some function value like sin, cos, tan and their inverse function value, log, ln etc.
As this is my first project thats why the  frontend design is not much better.
